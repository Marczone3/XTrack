Welcome to XTrack,

This is the public repository for XTrack.
You will find all language files used in XTrack here.

If you want to help translate XTrack into you language:

   1)  Make a GitHub account
   2)  Clone this repo to your computer.
   3)  Copy the en_UK.lang file
   4)  Rename the file the following way: (two letters for the language (English:en))_(two letters for your country(United Kingdom: UK), this must be capital).lang -> resulting in for example for dutch: du_NE.lang.
   5)  Replace the parts after the '='with the appropriate translation. Do this for every line in the file. For example Welcome=Welcome becomes Welcome=Welkom, for the Dutch translation.
   6)  Once done commit your changes into this repo and wait for a verification.
   7)  Hopefully in the next release your language will then be implemented, but it will at least take a week or two after commitment.

On behalf of the XTrack Dev. Team,

Marc
